# Sethc-Admin-Exploit-Hider-Windows-7 

## What it does:
* takes the place of sethc.exe in Folder Windows/System32 
* acts like the original sethc, by starting the original sethc with its original dialog
* runs a background task which listens for the amount of runs (how often the 5-times shift function ran)
* every time (counter modulo 10) is true, it starts one cmd window with admin rights. (Counter = 1 initially)


## Properties:
> The objectShell.Environment("VOLATILE") method is really slow, adding an about 5 second delay to finish the script run.
> *But this helps in hiding the actual cmd functionality, as no-one tries for so long.

> Not waiting until the current script finishes results in counter not increasing.
> Means if pressed too frequently, nothing happens. patience is key to get to cmd.

> Script immediately runs sethc.exe from "C:\Windows\SysWOW64\sethc.exe", which can be changed.

> Script runs "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" on success, can also be changed.

> Script alerts the current counter-value, can be changed or hidden.

## Variants:
* One normal source code version
* one stealth obfuscated version, where alerts are silenced

## Comment:
I haven't tried if it works in other windows versions. if it does, just leave a comment.
